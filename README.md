# Python Basic Exams

This repository contains a collection of basic Python exercises and short exam-style problems I solved as part of my learning journey.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of Python fundamentals. These exercises helped me practice key programming concepts such as:

- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`)
- Functions and arguments
- String manipulation
- Lists, dictionaries, and sets

## What I Learned

- Writing clean and readable Python code
- Thinking through logic and solving problems step-by-step
- Debugging and testing small programs
- Organizing code into reusable functions

## Status

This is a static archive of my early Python practice. I'm keeping it in my portfolio to show the foundation of my programming skills.
